# BrumSchtick Auto-Updater (User Guide) 🔄✨🤹

> [!NOTE]
> The updater works only for official packaged builds. Dev builds are too wild for the update wizardry. 😜

## What the updater does 🧠🛠️
BrumSchtick can check GitHub Releases for newer versions, download the correct package for your platform, and install it on the next app shutdown.

Update flow:
1. Check for updates 🔍
2. Download the release asset 📥
3. Prepare the update (unzip) 🧰
4. Install on quit (or immediately if you choose "Install now") 🚀

## When the updater is available 🧩🕹️
The updater is enabled only for official packaged builds:

| 🖥️ Platform | ✅ Runs when... |
| --- | --- |
| Windows | Running `BrumSchtick.exe` from a packaged folder |
| macOS | Running `BrumSchtick.app` |
| Linux | Running the AppImage (requires the `APPIMAGE` environment variable) |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Development builds or renamed binaries may disable the updater.

## How to check for updates 🔍🚀
Open Preferences and go to the Updates section. There you can:

- 🔁 Check for updates manually
- 🕰️ Enable checks on startup
- 🧪 Include pre-releases (release candidates)
- 🧩 Include draft releases (if enabled by command line)

If an update is available, an "Update available" link appears. Clicking it opens the update dialog and lets you download and install the new version. ✨

## Installing an update 🧰✨
After downloading, the updater prepares the update and shows a dialog with two options:

- 🚀 Install now: BrumSchtick quits, installs the update, and restarts
- 💤 Install later: the update installs automatically the next time you quit

## Permissions and prompts 🔐⚠️
If BrumSchtick is installed in a protected location, the updater may need extra permissions:

- 🪟 Windows: you may see a UAC prompt during installation
- 🍎 macOS/Linux: write access to the app location is required

## Where files are stored 📦🗂️
During an update, temporary files are stored in the system temp folder under a `BrumSchtick-update` directory. A log file is written to your user data directory:

- `BrumSchtick-update.log`

This log is useful for troubleshooting update failures. 🧯

## Privacy 🕵️‍♀️🚫
The updater only contacts GitHub to check for releases and to download update assets. It does not send personal data.

## Troubleshooting 🧯😵
- 🔎 If no update is found, verify that your build is an official package and that the release exists on GitHub.
- 🛠️ If installation fails, download the latest ZIP from the Releases page and replace the app manually.
- 📜 If you see an error, check `BrumSchtick-update.log` for details.
